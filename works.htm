<br><b>1. Horizon</b>
<br>The navigation of the sea is a question of how to inhabit our world. As waves roll back and forth by the pull of gravity, their course index in collision with a picture plane.
<br>The presumption of a stable horizon anchors the modern world and its perspectival representation. These rationalizations privilege a reality that is quantifiable and deterministic.
<br>Under this premise, we sense only what is sensible, and limit potential to that which we can understand and possess. An architecture based in this worldview serves only to reproduce itself.

            <p><b>2. Ellipse</b>
            <br>Relativity was proven by the observation of light bending around the solar eclipse: gravity distorting space and delaying time. Under a premise of time and space
            <br>that are elastic and relative to points of view, meaning is displaced from independent bodies to mutual relationships in motion, a dialectic of process and attention.
            <br>It becomes important to develop a language and conceptual structure considering a logic of mass, gravity, indolence, and desire ( ( which is distortion )
            <br>which is temporal and elliptical )
            <br>

              <br><br><br>The rotating apparatus demonstrates the pull of multiple foci, whose gravities exert upon one another, sustaining elliptical movement, revolution, and evolution.
              <br>They enact an ethics of subjects in reciprocity. Within a mode of sensing that does not presuppose the stability of space and time, in which observer and observed
              <br>are in flux, each possessing subjectivity and agency, time and space begin to take on a quality: of texture, geography, or constellation,
              <br>moving in continual relation, interdependence, and proportion.
              <br>
              <br>Each rotating body contains a different duration (number of frames and stills)
              <br>As they move they collide and interact with one another in a different way each time
              <br>What happens at the intersection of 2 trajectories, at the moment of tangency--collision?
              <br>
              <br>The horizon of this apparatus is maintained by a track cut along the sides of the bodies which holds a wire.
              <br>The mechanism holds together while allowing for rotation.
              <br>The horizon, then, is the sum of all tangencies.

<p><b>3. Parenthesis</b>
<br>The interaction of the film is a point of absorbing X projecting. Subject and object are superimposed: a marbling of elements "commenting on each other like a cinematic montage"<sup>1</sup>,
<br>a construction of self thru empathy and exchange of positions. The horizon is redefined as a mutually constituted temporal structure in its redistribution of the sensible.
<br>Then we must rely on fiction, distortion, and transformation as reference for a new horizon.
