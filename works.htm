<br>1. Horizon
<br>The navigation of the sea is a question of how to inhabit our world. As waves move back and forth due to the attraction of gravity, their movement is captured in the collision with a picture plane.
<br>The presumption of a stable horizon anchors the modern worldview and perspectival representation. Its rationalizations privilege a sense of reality that is quantifiable and deterministic. Under this premise, we sense only what is sensible, and limit our potential to that which we can understand and possess. An architecture based on this worldview serves only to reproduce itself.

            <br>2. Ellipse
            <br>Relativity was proven by the observation of light bending around the solar eclipse: gravity distorting space and delaying time. Under an idea of time and space as elastic and relative to points of view, meaning is displaced from independent bodies to mutual relationships in motion, and to a dialectic of process and attention.
            <br>This thesis develops a language and conceptual structure following a logic of mass, gravity, indolence, and desire (which is distortion) - which is temporal and elliptical.

              The rotating machine demonstrates the pull of multiple foci, whose gravities exert upon one another, sustaining elliptical movement, revolution, and evolution. They enact an ethics of subjects in reciprocity. Within a mode of sensing that does not presuppose the stability of space and time, in which observer and observed are in flux, each possessing subjectivity and agency, time and space begin to take on a quality: of texture, geography, or constellation, moving in constant relation, interdependence, and proportion.

              <br>Each rotating body contains a different duration (number of frames and content). As they move they collide and interact with one another in a different way each time. What happens at the intersection of 2 trajectories, at the moment of tangency or collision?

              <br>The horizon of this model is maintained by a track cut along the sides of the bodies which holds a wire. The mechanism holds together while allowing for movement. This horizon, then, is the sum of all tangencies.

<br>3. Parenthesis
<br>The interaction of the film is a moment of absorbing and projecting at the same time. The subject and object are superimposed. In this reverberation, a multiplicity of time and spaces creates possibilities of juxtapositioning and marbling of elements commenting on each other like a cinematic montage, and a way of construction of self via empathy or exchange of positions.
<br>The horizon is redefined by a new mutually constituted temporal structure and its redistribution of the sensible. We then must rely on fiction, distortion or transformation as the reference for a new horizon.
